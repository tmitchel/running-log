# Running Log

A simple app to log the quality of my runs and what I listened to while running. Eventually, I will investigate any relationships between podcasts and run quality.

## Usage
Install the app
```
git clone git@github.com:tmitchel/running-log.git
```

Start the docker containers for the app and for redis
```
docker-compose up
```

Connect to `localhost:8000`
